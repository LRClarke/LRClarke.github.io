## Measuring the Effectiveness of Urban Forest Park Development to Offset the Urban Heat Island Effect in Portland, Oregon
<img src="images/3minutemaps4.png?raw=true"/>
As part of the Arbor Day Foundation the city of Portland, Oregon has been named a Tree City. Like most large cities, Portland is subject to the urban heat accumulations. When separated by census block groups the mean 2018 afternoon temperature and percent canopy cover have a correlation coefficient of -0.89. My idea was that urban forest parks would be a fitting remedy to the heat islands, given its status as a Tree City. This plan would treat all vacant lots as viable options to develop urban forest parks. I have found 4 census blocks with seemingly enough vacant lots, yet I consider this annalysis to be inconclusive. This is inconclusive because of the rudimentary techniques; it is with vector data and limited to arbitrary census block boundaries. Someday I wish to obtain reliable results with more advanced methods, using rasters and thermal imagery.

## Interpretive Design
<img src="images/cephlopods.png?raw=true"/>
In my Undergraduate career I focused on interpretive graphic design to promote science to the public. The porpse of this is to be an eye catching sign in aquarium facilities. The dark colors are suitable for the dim lighting in aquariums for easier legibility. Unfortunatly I have misplaced the thumbdrive with the original png file.

Paleoart is mostly interpretation based on scientific knowledge from fossil evidence and present day animal traits.
These are some of my interpretations of Deinonychus. 
I have a dedication for education and interpretation to correct popular belief and misconceptions. My goal is to show the public a more accurate portrayal of the non-avian dinosaurs with my art. The non-avian dinosaurs were typical animals, not godzilla-esque monsters.
