[Measuring the Effectiveness of Urban Forest Park Development to Offset the Urban Heat Island Effect in Portland, Oregon](/sample_page)
<img src="images/3minutemaps4.png?raw=true"/>
As part of the Arbor Day Foundation the city of Portland, Oregon has been named a Tree City. Like most large cities, Portland is subject to the urban heat accumulations. When separated by census block groups the mean 2018 afternoon temperature and percent canopy cover have a correlation coefficient of -0.89. My idea was that urban forest parks would be a fitting remedy to the heat islands, given its status as a Tree City. This plan would treat all vacant lots as viable options to develop urban forest parks. I have found 4 census blocks with seemingly enough vacant lots, yet I consider this annalysis to be inconclusive. This is inconclusive because of the rudimentary techniques; it is with vector data and limited to arbitrary census block boundaries. Someday I wish to obtain reliable results with more advanced methods, using rasters and thermal imagery.
